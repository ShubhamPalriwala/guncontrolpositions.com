# guncontrolpositions.com

The purpose of this site is to share the positions that our politicians take on gun control. Seated officials and candidates for their positions can be included.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome. There are lots of politicians and lots of statements; it'll take a community to keep this fresh.

The content of this site is derived from this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fLGuUuYjk94p31hbpKFfQuhUsrz1rCpQgQ6z2VaA3RY/edit?usp=sharing) and everyone is able to contribute by commenting on the spreadsheet (right-click on a cell and leave your note). This is the fastest way to contribute. Your comments will be read by a moderator and added to the cell.

Trusted participants will be granted *moderator* status and can edit data across the spreadsheet. Changes are visible on the site in real-time.

If you're a developer, participate in making the site more functional on Github.
