									<h3>Greg Abbot - R</h3>
									<p>Greg Abbott believes the right to keep and bear arms was settled in 1791 when the 2nd Amendment was adopted to the U.S. Constitution. On behalf of 31 states, Greg Abbott <strong>championed a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision (District of Columbia v. Heller) that struck down a handgun ban</strong> and protected an individual’s right to bear arms while he was Texas’ Attorney General. He was also one of the first Attorneys General in America to challenge the Obama Administration’s efforts to use the United Nations to regulate guns in the United States.</p>

									<p>As Governor, Greg Abbott <strong>expanded 2nd Amendment rights, signing into law "campus carry" and "open carry."</strong></p>
											
									<p>As an avid hunter and <strong>member of the Texas State Rifle Association and National Rifle Association</strong>, Greg Abbott <strong>will continue to fight any federal government overreach that aims to disrupt the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding Texans.</strong>

But please keep in mind, given the current state of politics, I have to play a multi-year strategy that gets us to a solution. - <a href="https://voterguide.dallasnews.com/2018-primary/candidates/38/">Dallas News</a></p>

											<h4>D - Andrew White</h4>
											<p>When I’m elected governor of the biggest gun-owning state in the USA, I’ll work directly with the CEOs of the largest gun retailers. We’ll discuss how the gun industry should themselves lead on gun safety to build goodwill and good policy. And I’ll point to Wal-Mart’s gun policy as a start--it’s STRONGER than the law requires. If a retailer doesn’t want to participate, we’ve got sensible gun legislation groups that will send their members to shop elsewhere. Trust me. When the dollars walk away, the retailers will come back. - <a href="https://www.andrewwhite.com/guns/">Candidate Website</a></a></p>

											<ol>
											    <li>Verifiable background checks. We need some mechanism to prosecute those who supply false information on firearms background checks.
											    <li>All gun transactions, not just the original purchase, first should include a Bill of Sale filed with the state to protect the seller and buyer. This should be the buyers’ and sellers’ responsibility for 10 years or given to local law and held on there for ten years. Tracing illegal gun sales is impossible without this.
											    <li>Automatic weapons and devices that transform semi-automatic into automatic weapons have no business in private hands.
											    <li>Firearm limitations for:
												<ol>
												    <li>Our schools and universities unless carried by law enforcement or security personnel.
												    <li>Repeat alcohol and drug offenders. We take licenses away from people for several DUI offenses, why not the same standard for buying firearms?
												    <li>Individuals who have restraining orders against them for domestic abuse so long as the order is in place. A spouse should not live in fear that his or her abusive partner can obtain a gun.
												    <li>Individuals in institutional treatment for mental health issues when released. The current five-year probationary period is not long enough.
												    <li>People who qualify for the government’s “No-Fly” list.

											<p>"I stand strong on my commitment to protect the right to keep and bear arms. Every school shooting is a tragedy, but <strong>I refuse to allow this or any other tragedy to be used to strip the rights of Americans to defend themselves</strong>. It's remarkable: The President, Members of Congress, Governors, Mayors - they're protected with guns. Even the suspected shooter in Florida is now protected by people with guns, but our children get a sign that says "Gun Free Zone." Murderers care not for law. Decreasing access to firearms to criminals to a significant degree would require mass restrictions and confiscation nationwide. Full stop. Such a recourse is wholly unacceptable to a freedom-loving people, and anything short of that is unlikely to make any difference." - <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/politics/North-Texas-Congressional-Delegation-Asked-About-Florida-School-Shooting-474232543.html">NBC</a></p>

											<p>"First, Trump's proven mendacity should eclipse any credibility of his claims. Second, I would immediately vote to support Senator Cornyn's bipartisan, 'Fix NICS Act' including the <strong>ban on sales of novelty 'bump stock' conversion kits</strong>. I support <strong>universal background checks</strong>. I would author or support legislation to <strong>ban high-capacity magazines, 30-rounds and higher</strong>, being used by these madmen to slaughter innocent civilians. I would also vote to support <strong>banning the sale of military style body armor to civilians</strong>." - <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/politics/North-Texas-Congressional-Delegation-Asked-About-Florida-School-Shooting-474232543.html">NBC</a></p>
